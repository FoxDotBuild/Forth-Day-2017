# About Me

# About You
 * Experience Levels
 * Backgrounds
 * Goals

# What Are We Doing Today?
 * Learn how computers work through Forth.
 * A few lab experiments

# History
 * Chuck Moore
 * First project
 * 80's Heyday
 * Forth today

# Common Use Cases for Forth
 * Firmware
 * Firmware
 * Resource constrained applications
 * Firmware

# Advantages
 * Can be easily ported to new systems / platforms
 * _very_ resource efficient
 * "Low Floor, High Ceiling"

# Real World Forth
 * [Power Plant Control Systems](https://www.forth.com/solar-power-plant-controls/)
 * [Philae Lander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philae_(spacecraft))
 * [Fignition](https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/fignition-gets-a-keyboard)
 * GA 144

# Why Bother?
 * It's fun!
 * Less tooling to learn than C
 * The only language a developer can _completely_ understand quickly.
 * Makes you a better programmer
 * Influences your understanding of other languages.
 * Low level concepts are easier

# Minimalism
 * No Garbage Collector
 * (sometimes) No Floating Point Numbers
 * No Type System / Type Checker

# Start Actually Learning Forth Now

# Lab Setup
   * Terminal
   * Text editor
   * Check that all the expected words are there
   * Install a "whoops" marker
   * Talk about lecture/lab format

# Hello, World!
  * LAB: `." Hello, world!"`
# Basic Math
  * LAB: 3rd grade math class
# The Stack
   * LAB: `.s`, `.` and the stack
   * LAB: RPN, `+`, `-`, `dup`, `swap`
# I/O
   * LAB: "Hello, {{ name }}"
   * LAB: "It's over {{ 9000 }}"
# -------
   * LAB: `words`
   * LAB: Create your own words `: add2 2 + ; words`
   * LAB: Redefine a word
   * LAB: Create a new marker
   * LAB: Create a constant
   * LAB: Create a variable
   * LAB: Read a variable
   * LAB: Create a `FOO+!` word
   * LAB: Create a `FOO@` word
   * LAB: Can/Can't drink beer
   * LAB: 3 2 1 blastoff
   * LAB: Blink
   * LAB: Push to blink
   * LAB: PWM write
   * LAB PWM read
   * LAB: Fire alarm

# Next steps (part II?)
 * "big" Forths
 * Execution tokens
 * Vectored execution
 * Compile vs. interpret
 * inner vs. outter interpreter
 * Defining words
 * Tasks
 * Vocabularies
 * Dictionary structure
 * recursion
 * Stephen's Book
