# Common Use Cases for Forth
 * Firmware
 * Firmware
 * Resource constrained applications
 * Firmware

# Advantages
 * Can be easily ported to new systems / platforms
 * _very_ resource efficient
 * "Low Floor, High Ceiling"

# Real World Forth
 TODO: Add clickable links.
 * GA 144
 * Bubble
 * Fignition
 * Satellite stuff
 * Various "hobby forths"

# Why Bother?
 * It's fun!
 * Makes you a better programmer
 * Influences your understanding of other languages.
 * The only language a developer can _completely_ understand quickly.
 * Low level concepts are easier
 * Less tooling to learn than C

# Minimalism
 * No Garbage Collector
 * (sometimes) No Floating Point Numbers
 * No Type System / Type Checker

# Course Format Explanation
 * Setup
   * Terminal
   * Text editor
   * Check that all the expected words are there
   * Install a "whoops" marker
   * Talk about lecture/lab format
# Hello, World!
  * LAB: Create a marker `poof!` (more later)
  * LAB: `." Hello, world!"`
# Basic Math
  * LAB: 3rd grade math class
# The Stack
   * LAB: `.s`, `.` and the stack
   * LAB: RPN, `+`, `-`, `dup`, `swap`
# I/O
   * LAB: "Hello, {{ name }}"
   * LAB: "It's over {{ 9000 }}"
# -------
   * LAB: `words`
   * LAB: Create your own words `: add2 2 + ; words`
   * LAB: Redefine a word
   * LAB: Create a new marker
   * LAB: Create a constant
   * LAB: Create a variable
   * LAB: Read a variable
